        The Lute.
    </h1>
    <p>
        The lute is a stringed instrument and can be seen as a predecessor to the modern day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar">guitar</a> <br>It could be plucked and strummed just like a guitar but had much more strings, potentially having up to 15 strings. <br>The lute originates from Arabic countries with instruments like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud">Arabid Oud</a> being eerily similar to the European lute. <br>The oud was brought to Europe through Spain in the 8th and 9th centuries and gained popularity through the continent before creating its own version thus known as the lute in the 13th century. <br>The lute was generally used for music to be able to dance along to, before slowly the pieces gradually became more nuanced and complicated with more techniques and fingerwork. <br>The lute also had a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archlute">Archlute</a> , being a hybrid between the lute and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorbo">Theorbo.</a>

        The Harpsichord.
    </h1>
    <p>
        The harpsichord, although also being a member of the string family, is actually an early predecessor to the modern day concert grand piano. <br>The harpsichord was believed to be first developed in the middle ages, and by the 16th century there were many regional variants of the harpsichord all around Europe; Italian harpsichords were lightweight and had low string tension, while Dutch variants were much heavier, giving off a more powerful sound. <br>The instrument works like this; the player presses a key, as the other end of the key rises, it lifts a long strip of wood, called a jack. <br>To the jack is attached a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plectrum">Plectrum</a> key thus creating the sound-
