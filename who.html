        Claudio monteverdi (1567-1643)
    </h1>
    <p>
        Taught by marc’antonio ingegneri<br>
        Cremona italy<br>
        1592 he was appointed as a violin player to duke vincenzo I of mantua<br>
        His multiple journeys with monteverdi made it seem like his importance was increasing, someone else was offered de werts post upon its vacancy (his death) in 1596<br>
        Dissatisfied with his situation, upon the dukes death he decided to leave the court accepting maestro di cappella of st. marks in venice in 1613<br>
        He went on and wrote some of the most influential compositions in early baroque including 1610s vespro della beata\e vergine (vespers of the blessed virgin)<br>
        He also published 9 books of madrigals between 1587 and 1651<br>
